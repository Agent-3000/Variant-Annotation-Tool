# Variant-Annotation-Tool

The Variant Annotation Tool is a web-based application for annotating genetic variants identified from sequencing data. It provides comprehensive annotations for genetic variants, including functional effects, allele frequencies, pathogenicity scores, clinical significance, and gene/protein information.

## Features

- Annotate genetic variants from VCF files with relevant information.
- Retrieve allele frequencies from population databases (e.g., gnomAD, 1000 Genomes).
- Calculate or retrieve pathogenicity scores (e.g., SIFT, PolyPhen) to predict variant deleteriousness.
- Retrieve clinical annotations from databases like ClinVar to identify disease-associated variants.
- Provide gene and protein information, including gene names, transcript IDs, and protein domains.
- Visualize annotated variants with interactive tables, plots, and graphs.
- Filter and sort variants based on specific criteria, such as allele frequency thresholds and predicted pathogenicity scores.
- Export annotated variant data in various formats for further analysis or integration with other tools.
